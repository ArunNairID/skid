Simple, plaintext, file system


Great post by GradHacker: [[http://www.gradhacker.org/2012/08/13/towards-better-pdf-management-with-the-filesystem/][Towards Better PDF Management with the Filesystem]]

 - tools for organizating you pdfs are restrictive (and proprietary in the sense
   that information is owned by the program).

 - Article advocates
   1. use filesystem: helps avoid the "proprietary data problem"
   2. flat structure: keeping a single (flat) directory of all your papers
   3. tags over folders: well-known problem we all faced before GMail.
   4. conventions: naming conventions, tagging conventions
   5. "simple scripts": they don't say it directly (must not a linux geek), but
      they talk about using simple programs rather large monolithic programs.


Documents (or links to documents) go in cache.

Each document has a directory either in a parallel directory or right next to
it, which will hold metadata (just like Rexa). For example.

    cache/
        somefile.ext
        somefile.ext.d/
            bibtex
            notes.org
            data/
                text
                hash

Now, we can write command-line scripts which will query this data set.

Examples include:

 - keyword search: over the plaintext content or descriptions. This might
   require building an inverted index.

 - metadata:
   - notes:
   - "machine-readable notes": title, tags, source, plaintext

 - information displays: what do we know about a particular file. E.g. print
   bibtex entries, tags, and comments for research papers.

================================================================================
Adding a document

  1. cache document (download links, copy pdfs)
  2. create '.d' directory
  3. create notes.org file (initialize content, e.g. title, tags)
  4. merge with any existing notes.org
  5. open description file in a text editor

Merging

 - anything automatically replaces null.
 - conflict can be dealt with via kdiff3 or possibly some emacs extension.

Keeping data safe

 - staging area
 - version control (maybe something like working, incoming, remote)

Outstanding issues

 - What if I don't want to write notes about a specific single paper, but rather
   on a topic or something ... for example the learn directories...

================================================================================
Things I fumble about trying to do:

 - looking up a paper's directory so that I could copy files into its folder

 - jumping to ~/.skid directory (e.g. to check on hg)

   * created alias 'skidd' (why can't python cd like a bash script)

   * added 'skid hg ...' subcommand.

 - narrowing search: keyword search returns too many results. I want to "pick"
   one paper (pick can mean open, take notes, grab metadata).

   Approaches (not mututally exclusive):

   * ranking: give preference to certain fields like filename, author, title,
     and notes before text.

   * autocomplete/suggestion: (todo: could look at discriminating words between
     results)

   Both approaches should be combined. Autocomplete/suggestion might require an
   interactive user interface.
